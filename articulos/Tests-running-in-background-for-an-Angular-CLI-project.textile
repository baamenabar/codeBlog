h1. Test running in background for an Angular CLI project

h2. TL;DR:

1. Install @karma-cli@ globally with npm or yarn
2. Run @karma start --single-run=false --auto-watch=true --coverage@ 

That will overwrite the deafult behaviour of running Karma from the Angular CLI @ng test@ and loading the karma.conf.js

The which is like running the @ng test --code-coverage@ 

You can also set it up more granularly in the @karma.conf.js@ file.

h2.  Skip from code coverage

Some things you donÂ´t have to test, like mocks, to prevent them from ruining your coverage use:

bc. /* istanbul ignore next */

for istambul to ignore the next line
