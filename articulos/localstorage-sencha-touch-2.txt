LocalStorage through Store.sync() on Sencha Touch 2
===================================================

Storing persisten information in a sencha app, cookies aren't available for all devices, localstorege has wonderful support with Phonegap (Cordova).


	Ext.define('MyApp.store.LocalStuff',{
		extend: 'Ext.data.Store',
		xtype:'localstuff',

		config: {
			fields:['stuffId','stuffName','stuffArray'],
			storeId:'LocalStuffId',
			proxy:{
				type:'localstorage',
				id:'idForLocalStorage',
				reader: {
					type: 'json',
					rootProperty: 'stuffArray'
				}
			}
		}
	});

Assuming you´ve populated the store with something like:

	{'stuffArray':[
		{'stuffId':'130',	'stuffName':'floob',	'stuffArray':[	
																	'first',
																	'second',
																	'tird' //here be a typo (on purpose)
																	]
																},
		{'stuffId':'131',	'stuffName':'sateo',	'stuffArray':[	
																	'primero',
																	'segundo',
																	'tercero'
																	]
																},
		{'stuffId':'133',	'stuffName':'tolus',	'stuffArray':[	
																	'prima',
																	'secunda',
																	'tertia'
																	]
																}
		]
	}
	// to fix the first's record misspelling you might be tempted to do the following

	{//in a given controller or view
		someEventHandler:function(){
			var stor = Ext.getStore('LocalStuffId');
			var firstRecord = stor.getAt(0);//which will get you a record in the form of a Model
			firstRecord.get('stuffArray')[2]='third';//that will fix it
			//now we just sync() to make the change persist when we close the app
			stor.sync();
		}
	}

/*If you tried this there will be no errors on the console, so, all is ok. Right?
wrong! The changes won't persist on restart. Why? 
Because the records are “clean”. 
How can we “dirty” them up?
The only way I found (I'm sure there are plenty more) is by using the method **.set()** from the Model to update the record, that'll tell the store it's dirty
That sounds odd to my untrained brain on MVC, better fixing the above example.

{//in a given controller or view
	someEventHandler:function(){
		var stor = Ext.getStore('LocalStuffId');
		var firstRecord = stor.getAt(0);//which will get you a record in the form of a Model
		//you might go around the following 2 lines in many ways, the important part is .set() after that
		var theArrayToFix = firstRecord.get('stuffArray');
		theArrayToFix[2]='third';

		firstRecord.set('stuffArray',theArrayToFix);//set() dirties the record
		//NOW we sync() to make the change persist when we close the app
		stor.sync();
	}
