h1. Docker Compose with Digital Ocean real world application

</hgroup></header>


p(intro). Since we learnt that the dockerized @fly-image@ project runs smoothly on a local envionment. We can set it up for production work on a Digital Ocean Droplet.

h2(#ac2). __[fr]Mise en place__, What we'll need

* A Digital Ocean account (the account itself it's free)
* "fly-image":https://github.com/sadok-f/fly-image (WIP) a image conversion/compression microservice project (take a look for now, we'll clone later)

The rest we'll write up from scratch.

Go to our Digital Ocean dashboard and just create a new droplet.

For best Docker compatibility use Ubuntu 14 x64. Ubuntu because Docker was built originally for Ubuntu. Version 14 because most documentation is for 14, so we'll just choose that too, but it should not be different for other versions. Choose the closest region to you or our audience.

To have an initial config of users and libraries we will take advantage of the *cloud-config* field available, where we can add YAML instructions to provision the server.

bc. 
#cloud-config
users:
  - name: leopold
    groups: sudo
    shell: /bin/bash
    sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
package_upgrade: true
packages:
  - git
  - python-pip

Also add your SSH key in the fields so you can ssh as a root user without password.

Just put a name to our server (in my case @flyimage@) and start the droplet.

After the image is created and the server started we have to ssh to our machine with root and set up the user that will use Docker.

h2(#ac4). Setting up the user for Docker

Half the works was already done by the @cloud-config@ script, we need to setup keys and passwords only.

Once logged in as root, we can set the password for the user leopold:

bc. password leopold
# ...and follow instructions

Or even better add our public ssh key for leopold (I'm assuming you have an ssh key already on your system). For that we create the @.ssh@ directory and inside we add our key to the user's trusted keys.

bc. su leopold
cd ~
mkdir .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh
vim .ssh/authorized_keys
# the last line doesn't have to be vim, use whatever you like.

Here add the public key from our machine, we only need to declare the contents of the list on the first line, then paste the contents of your public key, it should look like this:

bc. id_rsa.pub contents
ssh-rsa AVKKEuah+pFS/1/and/a/lot/more/characters/bXBnkjuYgG9hhh me@local.machine

Save and exit, now we re-set permissions for the permisionis list.

bc. chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
# and exit the user leopold
exit
# we are now as root user

Since user @leopold@ is already in the sudoers list we can just block access to login with root. This is a best practice for every server.

bc. vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Look for the line with: @PermitRootLogin yes@ and change it to @PermitRootLogin no@ . Save and close vim.

Now we restart @ssh@ service to the changes apply. And on a separate console window or session you should check that login in works with *leopold*.

bc. ssh leopold@123.45.6.7

If so, just close the root session and continue in the *leopold* session.

h2(#ac5). Installing Docker and Docker Compose

*Important:* These steps must be done on a user, not on root.
